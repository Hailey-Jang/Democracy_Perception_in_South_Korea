could you write the abstract which is included and appropriately pitched to a non-specialist audience. The abstract answers: 1) what was done, 2) what was found, and 3) why this matters (all at a high level). Likely four sentences. Abstract must make clear what we learn about the world because of this paper. add the context of methodology which is use of linear regression mode

This study investigates how South Korea's rapid socio-economic changes, driven by globalization, influence citizens' perceptions of democracy, with a particular emphasis on the importance of compromise in democratic governance. By conducting a survey among various demographic groups and analyzing the data through a linear regression model, the research identifies clear variations in democratic perceptions based on age and gender. The findings reveal that different demographic groups hold distinct views on the necessity of compromise in a democracy, and these views significantly correlate with their overall satisfaction with democratic processes. This study underscores the importance of understanding demographic-specific attitudes towards democracy in South Korea, highlighting the need for policies that foster greater inclusivity and responsiveness in democratic governance amidst global changes.

The below script worked. but how can I shorten the name of Dissatisfaction_with_economy", "Distrust_level_agianst_politicians", "Dissatisfaction_with_politics? 

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the data
analysis_data <- read_csv("/Users/hailey/Desktop/Democracy_Perception_in_South_Korea/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")

# Create a long format of the data for plotting

analysis_data_long <- pivot_longer(analysis_data, 
                                   cols = c("Dissatisfaction_with_economy", "Distrust_level_agianst_politicians", "Dissatisfaction_with_politics"), 
                                   names_to = "Perception_Type", 
                                   values_to = "Perception_Score")

ggplot(analysis_data_long, aes(x = Age, y = Perception_Score, fill = Age)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = mean, position = position_dodge()) +
  facet_wrap(~Perception_Type, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Average Perception Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1))

To shorten the names of the variables Dissatisfaction_with_economy, Distrust_level_against_politicians, and Dissatisfaction_with_politics in the plot, you can create a named vector that maps the long names to the desired short names. Then, use this vector to rename the levels of the Perception_Type factor after you have reshaped the data with pivot_longer. Here's how you would modify the script:

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)

# Load the data
analysis_data <- read_csv("/Users/hailey/Desktop/Democracy_Perception_in_South_Korea/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")

# Create a long format of the data for plotting
analysis_data_long <- analysis_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("Dissatisfaction_with_economy", "Distrust_level_against_politicians", "Dissatisfaction_with_politics"), 
    names_to = "Perception_Type", 
    values_to = "Perception_Score"
  )

# Create a named vector for mapping long names to short names
name_map <- setNames(
  c("Eco. Dissat.", "Pol. Distrust", "Pol. Dissat."),
  c("Dissatisfaction_with_economy", "Distrust_level_against_politicians", "Dissatisfaction_with_politics")
)

# Use the name map to rename the levels of Perception_Type
analysis_data_long$Perception_Type <- factor(analysis_data_long$Perception_Type,
                                             levels = names(name_map),
                                             labels = name_map[names(name_map)])

# Now plot with the shortened names
ggplot(analysis_data_long, aes(x = Age, y = Perception_Score, fill = Age)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = mean, position = position_dodge()) +
  facet_wrap(~Perception_Type, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Average Perception Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1))

With this code, Perception_Type will now have the shortened names when it is plotted. This will make your facet labels much shorter and more readable.

Error in `filter()`:
ℹ In argument: `Corruption_Perception != 8 &
  Economic_Perception != 8`.
Caused by error:
! object 'Corruption_Perception' not found
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

It seems like there might be a discrepancy in the column names used in the script and what's actually in the dataframe. It's important to ensure that the column names match exactly with those in your dataset, including case sensitivity.

Given the error, let's verify the column names and adjust the script accordingly. Based on your earlier description, the column names should be correct, but let's ensure they are accurately referenced. Here's a revised version of the script that explicitly uses the correct column names:

```r
# Load the necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Read the data from a CSV file
data <- read.csv("path_to_your_file/analysis_data.csv")

# Make sure to reference columns exactly as they appear in the dataframe
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Corruption_Perception != 8 & Economic_Perception != 8)

# View the first few rows of the filtered data to verify
head(filtered_data)

# Optionally, write the filtered data back to a new CSV file
write.csv(filtered_data, "path_to_your_file/filtered_analysis_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Ensure that:
- The column names in the `filter()` function exactly match those in your CSV file.
- The file paths are correctly specified.
- The `dplyr` library is correctly loaded.

If this script still results in errors, you might want to check the exact spelling and case of the column names directly in R using `colnames(data)` after loading your dataset. This will display all column names, and you can adjust the script accordingly if there's any mismatch.
